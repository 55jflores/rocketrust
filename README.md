Used the Rocket web framework with Rust to create an API for car parts

Car parts and its data is stored in an SQLite database

User enters year, make model and part. API returns the part they were looking for, alongisde other date regarding the part

Currently only hard coded for Nissan Altima. Database is currently limited with car parts as well
